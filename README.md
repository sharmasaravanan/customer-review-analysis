# Customer Review Analysis: Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Data

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from Yelp to determine the sentiment of the reviews. It's designed for beginners and aims to provide an introduction to sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP). The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Yelp dataset, training different NLP models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and BERT, and evaluating the performance of the models using Precision and Recall metrics.

## Project Duration
**Level:** Beginner  
**Duration:** 1 hour

## Project Steps

1. **Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Data**
   - Understanding the Yelp dataset.
   - Preprocessing and cleaning the data.
   - Labeling the data based on the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

2. **Learning Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Yelp Dataset**
   - Visualizing the distribution of sentiments.
   - Analyzing word frequencies and other textual features.
   - Exploring correlations between different features in the dataset.

3. **Training Different NLP Models**
   - Implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sentiment analysis.
   - Using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to improve sentiment prediction.
   - Comparing the performance of the models.

4. **Evaluating the Generated Answers**
   - Calculating Precision, Recall, and F1-score for the models.
   - Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each model based on evaluation metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- transformers[torch]
- Matplotlib or Seaborn (for visualization)

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-review-analysis.git

2. **Install the required packages:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook or script to start the analysis:**
  ```bash
  python3 customer_review_analysis.py
  ```

4. **Follow the steps in the notebook to perform sentiment analysis and evaluate the models.**


## Results

The final section of the project showcases the results of the sentiment analysis, including model performance based on Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Comparisons between RNN and BERT models are made, highlighting the improvements gained by using advanced NLP models.
